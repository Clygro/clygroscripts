# clygroscripts
Simple bash scripts I guess <br>
`installclygro.sh` - An install script for myself, installs the stuff I currently want to use. <br>
`controller.sh` - A script so my DualSense controller can actually be dected, it will act as if it's a Xbox 360 controller, taken from https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Gamepad#Playstation_5_(Dualsense)_controller <br>
`packagefixer.sh` - A incredibly simple one line script that fixed the issue of invailid or corrupted packages for pacman.
