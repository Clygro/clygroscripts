# clygroscripts
Simple bash scripts I guess, they are only a few lines worth of content. <br>
`installclygro.sh` - An install script for myself, installs the stuff I currently want to use. <br>
`controller.sh` - A script so my DualSense controller can actually be dected, it will act as if it's a Xbox 360 controller, taken from https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Gamepad#Playstation_5_(Dualsense)_controller <br>
`packagefixer.sh` - A incredibly simple one line script that fixed the issue of invailid or corrupted packages for pacman. <br>
`depaste.sh` - Disables the annoying middle click behaviour on X, where it pastes anything that gets selected. Taken from https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/24330/how-can-i-turn-off-middle-mouse-button-paste-functionality-in-all-programs/472464#472464 <br>
`paruinstaller.sh` - Installs the Paru AUR Helper, for Arch based systems, to use, type `paru` instead of `pacman`(no `sudo` required!). <br>
